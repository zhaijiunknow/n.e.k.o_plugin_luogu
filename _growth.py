"""Pure-function growth analysis and daily problem-set selection.

These functions take parsed submission/record data and a candidate problem pool
and produce a structured growth report plus a deterministic daily plan. They do
an explicit ``random.Random(daily_seed)`` so a given day yields the same plan
across restarts while varying day-to-day.

No SDK, no network, no ``_client`` — fully unit-testable.
